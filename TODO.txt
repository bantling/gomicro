- Make a FromJSON(typ interface{}) func that maps a JSONmap[string]interface{} element to a struct
- Make a simple REST muxer that sits on top of http.ServeMux
- Make a simple column based ORM that expects a struct where each field is a func
  - func name indicates what it does
  - eg, Save(struct), Delete(struct), DeleteById(id), struct Read(id)
  - name can be parseable like Spring data (simpler spec)
    - eg, FindByFirstNameOrderByLastNameDesc(firstName string)
    - more complex case:
      Customer(FirstName, LastName) contains multiple Address(Line, City, Region, Country)
      FindByFirstName_Address_City_OrderBy_Address_Region_LastNameDesc(firstName, city string)
      - select from customer c join address a on c.id = address.customerId 
         where customer.firstName and address.city match args
- Make a simple JSON based ORM that works similarly, assuming each child json object is merged into parent with a key
